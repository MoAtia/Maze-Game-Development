# Model Performance Comparison

This project compares the performance of four different machine learning classifiers:

- SVM
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

The evaluation is based on the following metrics:
- **Accuracy**
- **F1 Score**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**

## Metric Comparison Table

| Model               | Accuracy | F1 Score | Precision | Recall |
|---------------------|----------|----------|-----------|--------|
| SVM                 | 0.93     | 0.93     | 0.93      | 0.93   |
| Decision Tree       | 0.94     | 0.94     | 0.94      | 0.94   |
| Random Forest       | 0.97     | 0.97     | 0.97      | 0.97   |
| XGBoost             | 0.98     | 0.98     | 0.98      | 0.98   |

## Summary

- **XGBoost** outperforms all other models across all metrics.
- **Random Forest** is a close second, with strong performance.
- **Decision Tree** and **SVM** are suitable for simpler tasks but underperform relative to ensemble methods like Random Forest and XGBoost.
